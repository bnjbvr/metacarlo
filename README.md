===============

They told me templates are Turing complete, but I only believe in what my compiler can compile.

Also, constexpr allow you to do the same thing properly.

wat
===

This program computes the value of Pi at compile-time, using a Monte-Carlo method.

tldr
=========================

- `make`
- `./meta-montecarlo`
- `./meta-constexpr`

why
===

Because we can.

but templates are awful
=======================

It happens.
